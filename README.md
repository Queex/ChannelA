# ChannelA
A simple Renpy project that generates endless random anime series suggestions, used for convention panel based on the 'Channel A' card game.

Someone requested that the code for this be made available open source, so I have done so.

It's rather claggy, with two different methods used check verb agreement and so on. Probably full of stuff owrthy of TheDailyWTF.
