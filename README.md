# ChannelA
A simple Renpy project that generates endless random anime series suggestions, used for convention panel based on the 'Channel A' card game.

Someone requested that the code for this be made available open source, so I have done so.

It's rather claggy, with two different methods used check verb agreement and so on. Probably full of stuff worthy of TheDailyWTF.

This is a dump of the 'game' folder from a Renpy game. I'm sure what additional steps you'd need to take to recreate it on your local install, but good luck.
